##  Project Overview

**AI-Driven Insider Activity Detection System** is an end-to-end AI + cybersecurity solution designed to detect, monitor, and report insider threats in real-time. It combines packet-level data analysis, machine learning models, and an interactive dashboard for analysts.

---

##  Core Objectives

1. **Robust AI-based detection** of insider threats from activity logs and network packets.
2. **Real-time, intuitive dashboard** for cybersecurity teams and SOCs.
3. **Automated report generation** and alert system for threat response.

---

##  Key Features

###  Real-Time Detection
- **Packet Sniffing**: Using `Scapy` for live network capture.
- **Streaming & Buffering**: Handled via `Apache Kafka` for scalable data ingestion.
- **XGBoost Model**: Fast binary classification of anomalous activity from packet batches (aggregated every 50 packets).

###  Deep Anomaly Detection
- **Autoencoder Neural Network**: Trained on random sample of 13GB+ of engineered insider activity data for hidden pattern recognition.
- **Dask**: Used for parallelized data handling and feature engineering on Google Colab (T4 GPU).

###  Email Threat Analysis
- **VirusTotal API**: Scans email payloads and attachments to flag known malware and phishing attempts.

## ðŸ“Š Interactive Dashboard (Next.js)

- Real-time threat alerts with color-coded severity.
- Downloadable `.pcap` logs for forensic analysis.
- Incident tracking & analyst assignment.
- Timeline visualizations of suspicious user behavior.
- Clean UI/UX for Security Operations Centers (SOC).
